					Your browser doesn't support this element, here's what I'll do you!
						<br>
					Own a musket for home defense, since that's what the founding fathers intended. Four ruffians break into my house. "What the devil?" As I grab my powdered wig and Kentucky rifle. Blow a golf ball sized hole through the first man, he's dead on the spot. Draw my pistol on the second man, miss him entirely because it's smoothbore and nails the neighbors dog. I have to resort to the cannon mounted at the top of the stairs loaded with grape shot, "Tally ho lads" the grape shot shreds two men in the blast, the sound and extra shrapnel set off car alarms. Fix bayonet and charge the last terrified rapscallion. He bleeds out waiting on the police to arrive since triangular bayonet wounds are impossible to stitch up. Just as the founding fathers intended.

			<h1>Common Exercises</h1>
			<p>The following are common exercises that we encourage our clients to do as part of their daily exercise routine</p>
			
			<dl>
				<dt>Burpee</dt>
				<dd>Burpees are a great, full body exercise to increase your strength and endurance. Begin in a standing position, drop into a squat and extend forward again quickly, and then jump up from a squatted position. <b><span class="viewex" onClick="burpees()">View Example</span></b></dd>
				<dt>Plank</dt>
				<dd>Planks build your core strength. To preform a plank, get in a push up position and rest your forearms on the floor. Hold the position as long as you can <b><span class="viewex" onClick="plank()">View Example</span></b></dd>
				<dt>Mountain Climber</dt>
				<dd>Mountain climbers are a good cardio exercise. Place your hands on the floor in a push up position, then bring one knee up to your chest and then swich as quickly as you can. (As if you're climbing a mountain) <b><span class="viewex" onClick="mountain()">View Example</span></b></dd>
